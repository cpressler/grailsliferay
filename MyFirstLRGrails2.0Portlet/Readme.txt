This is what it works with

1)  Grails 2.0.2
2)  Liferay/Tomcat Bundle liferay-portal-6.1.0-ce-ga1
3)  built under Netbeans but it should not be specific

It includes and example public render parameter and events passing between portlets.

Key difference between 1.38 and 2.0.2 is how we get access to the portletResponse
