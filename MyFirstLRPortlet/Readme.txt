

In this directory is a version of a grails liferay portlet example. It provides a simple interface with one view.gsp page to test with.

This is what it works with

1)  Grails 1.3.8
2)  Liferay/Tomcat Bundle liferay-portal-6.1.0-ce-ga1
3)  built under Netbeans but it should not be specific

It includes and example public render parameter and events passing between portlets.
