    HOWTO: Debugging your charts with Chrome
</div>

    <h1>HOWTO: <span>Debugging your charts with Chrome</span></h1>

    <p>
        Debugging your charts becomes an awful lot easier if you use a Javascript console. This is where you'll find error messages
        and its these messages that can help you to trace the location of an error. This page focuses on the developer tools built into
        Chrome, however each browser will have its own developer tools - eg <a href="http://www.getfirebug.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Firebug</a>
        for Mozilla Firefox.
    </p>
    
    <h4>1. The Chrome developer tools in undocked mode</h4>
        <img src="../images/howto-debugging1.png" width="320" height="240" alt="The Chrome developer tools in undocked mode" style="float: right; box-shadow: 0 0 15px gray; margin: 10px" />
        
        <p>
            When you first open the developer tools in Chrome (you can press CTRL+SHIFT+J to open the tools) they usually look like this - ie in undocked mode.
            You may prefer this as it gives you more space initially or you may find that showing them in docked mode is more convenient.
            The button for switching modes is highlighted.
        </p>

    <h4>2. The Chrome developer tools in docked mode</h4>
    
        <img src="../images/howto-debugging2.png" width="320" height="240" alt="The Chrome developer tools in docked mode" style="float: right; box-shadow: 0 0 15px gray; margin: 10px" />
        
        <p>
            Here the tools are docked so that they appear joined to the main browser window at the bottom. Using them this way means that
            any Javascript errors will appear in the console which will make debugging your charts much easier.
        </p>
    
    <br clear="all" />
    
    <h3> More information</h3>
        <p>
            This is a video from Google IO 2010 detailing the development tools. Remember that other browsers as well as Chrome have
            developer tools - so refer to their documentation for more details.
